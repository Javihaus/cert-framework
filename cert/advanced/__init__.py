Advanced features for CERT Framework.

This module contains experimental and research-oriented tools:
- trajectory: Hamiltonian trajectory analysis for LLM generation monitoring
- coordination: Multi-agent coordination effectiveness measurement

These features require explicit import and additional dependencies.

Example:
    >>> from cert.advanced.trajectory import analyze_trajectory
    >>> from cert.advanced.coordination import CoordinationOrchestrator
