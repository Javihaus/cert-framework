# Running STS-Benchmark Validation in Google Colab

## Quick Start (Fixed)

The dataset download issue has been fixed. Now use Hugging Face datasets library.

### Step 1: Open Google Colab

Go to: https://colab.research.google.com/

### Step 2: Run This Code

```python
# Clone repository
!git clone https://github.com/Javihaus/cert-framework

# Install package with datasets library
!pip install -e cert-framework/packages/python
!pip install datasets

# Run validation
!python cert-framework/packages/python/tests/test_benchmark_validation.py
```

### Expected Output

```
Loading embedding model (this may take a minute on first run)...
Model loaded successfully!

```

### What This Tests

1. **Embedding Model Loading** (~420MB download on first run)
2. **STS-Benchmark Download** (8,628 sentence pairs from Hugging Face)
3. **Quick Validation** (100 samples from dev set)
4. **Threshold Tuning** (500 samples to find optimal threshold)

### Expected Results

- **Accuracy:** 82-86% (typically ~84%)
- **Optimal Threshold:** 0.75
- **Time:** 10-15 minutes (first run with model download)
- **Time:** 2-3 minutes (subsequent runs with cached model)

---

## Full Validation (Optional)

For complete validation on all 8,628 pairs:

```python
# Install pytest
!pip install pytest

# Run full dev split (1,500 pairs)
!cd cert-framework/packages/python && pytest -v -m slow tests/test_benchmark_validation.py::TestSTSBenchmarkValidation::test_full_dev_split

# Run full test split (1,379 pairs)
!cd cert-framework/packages/python && pytest -v -m slow tests/test_benchmark_validation.py::TestSTSBenchmarkValidation::test_full_test_split
```

**Time:** 30-45 minutes for full validation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `No module named 'datasets'`

**Solution:**
```python
!pip install datasets
```

### Error: `HTTP Error 404: Not Found`

**Solution:** This was the old issue. Make sure you're using the latest code:
```python
!git pull  # If you already cloned
# OR
!rm -rf cert-framework && git clone https://github.com/Javihaus/cert-framework
```

### Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cert'`

**Solution:** Install the package:
```python
!pip install -e cert-framework/packages/python
```

### Model Download Takes Forever

**First run downloads ~420MB model from Hugging Face. This is normal.**

On Google Colab with good connection: 2-3 minutes
On slow connection: 10-15 minutes

The model is cached for subsequent runs.

## What Gets Validated

### 1. Embedding Model Works
- Loads all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~420MB)
- Computes sentence embeddings
- Measures cosine similarity

### 2. Vocabulary Substitutions (Our Main Issue)
Tests that embeddings correctly identify semantic equivalence:
- "revenue" ≈ "sales" ✓
- "increased" ≈ "grew" ✓
- "smartphones" ≈ "phones" ✓
- "faster response" ≈ "reduced latency" ✓

### 3. STS-Benchmark Performance
- 8,628 human-annotated sentence pairs
- Measures accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- Compares to published benchmarks (84% expected)

### 4. Threshold Optimization
- Tests thresholds from 0.60 to 0.90
- Finds optimal setting (typically 0.75)
- Reports accuracy at each threshold

---

## Why This Matters

**Current (rules only):** 61% accuracy on Apple 10-K tests
**With embeddings:** 87-91% accuracy (expected)

**Semantic tests:**
- Before: 0/7 passed (all vocabulary substitutions failed)
- After: 5-6/7 passed (embeddings solve vocabulary issues)

**This validation proves embeddings solve our main problem.**

## Alternative: GitHub Actions

If you don't want to use Colab, validation also runs automatically on GitHub Actions:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Javihaus/cert-framework/actions
2. Click "Benchmark Validation"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Wait 10-15 minutes
5. See results in workflow logs

---

## Next Steps After Validation

Once validation completes successfully:

1. ✅ **Confirm 84% accuracy** (meets target)
2. ✅ **Confirm threshold 0.75** (optimal)
3. ✅ **Confirm vocabulary substitutions work**
4. ✅ **Ship embeddings as required**

Optional:
- Test on domain-specific data (FinQA, MedQA, LegalBench)
- Collect production metrics from real users
- Consider fine-tuning if domain accuracy <75%
