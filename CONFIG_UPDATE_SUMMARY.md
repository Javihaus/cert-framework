# Configuration Files Update Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Commit:** c3007a9
**Purpose:** Align all configuration files with v4.0 architecture

---

## Files Updated

### 1. **pytest.ini** ✅
**Changes:**
- Added new test markers:
  - `property`: For property-based tests using hypothesis
  - `validation`: For tests against ground truth datasets (STS-Benchmark)
  - `requires_evaluation`: For tests needing [evaluation] extras
  - `requires_cli`: For tests needing [CLI] extras
- Configured coverage reporting:
  - Minimum 85% coverage threshold (`--cov-fail-under=85`)
  - HTML, terminal, and XML reports
  - Coverage source set to `cert` package
- Added coverage exclusion rules for test files, abstract methods, debug code
- Improved warning filters to catch errors but ignore our own deprecations

**Impact:** Better test organization and coverage enforcement

---

### 2. **pyproject.toml** ✅
**Changes:**
- Updated version to `4.0.0`
- Changed description to: "LLM monitoring with EU AI Act Article 15 compliance automation"
- Changed license from `ISC/MIT` to `Apache-2.0`
- Set `dependencies = []` (zero dependencies for core)
- Reorganized `optional-dependencies` to match setup.py:
  - `evaluation`: ML models
  - `cli`: Click framework
  - `compliance`: Report generation
  - `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`: LLM providers
  - `langchain`, `autogen`, `crewai`: Frameworks
  - `observability`, `trajectory`, `inspector`: Advanced features
  - `dev`: Development tools
  - `all`: Everything
- Added keywords for discoverability: llm, monitoring, compliance, eu-ai-act, etc.
- Fixed entry point: `cert = "cert.cli.main:main"`
- Added tool configurations:
  - **Ruff**: Line length 100, Python 3.8 target, select linting rules
  - **MyPy**: Python 3.8, ignore missing imports, basic type checking

**Impact:** Proper package metadata for PyPI, consistent with setup.py

---

### 3. **scripts/release.sh** ✅
**Changes:**
- Now updates version in both `cert/__init__.py` AND `pyproject.toml`
- Split testing into two phases:
  1. **Core testing** (zero dependencies):
     ```bash
     pip install cert_framework.whl
     # Test: from cert import trace
     ```
  2. **Evaluation testing** (with extras):
     ```bash
     pip install cert_framework.whl[evaluation]
     # Test: from cert.evaluation import Evaluator
     ```
- Updated test commands to use new `@trace` API instead of old `@monitor`
- Added CLI command testing (`cert --version`, `cert --help`)
- Updated installation instructions to show extras options
- Improved documentation of release steps

**Impact:** Proper testing of modular architecture during releases

---

### 4. **Dockerfile** (NEW) ✅
**Created:** Modern, lightweight multi-stage Docker image

**Features:**
- Based on `python:3.11-slim`
- Build argument `EXTRAS` for customization:
  ```bash
  docker build -t cert:core .                         # Core only (~50MB)
  docker build --build-arg EXTRAS=evaluation -t cert:eval .  # With eval (~500MB)
  docker build --build-arg EXTRAS=all -t cert:full .         # Everything
  ```
- Creates `/var/log/cert` directory for logs
- Sets environment variables:
  - `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`
  - `CERT_LOG_PATH=/var/log/cert/traces.jsonl`
- Minimal system dependencies (build-essential only)

**Impact:** Easy containerization with size optimization

---

### 5. **docker-compose.yml** (NEW) ✅
**Created:** Complete monitoring stack example

**Services:**
1. **cert-core**: Core monitoring service
   - Lightweight (core only)
   - Mounts trace logs and application code
   - Runs your application with monitoring

2. **cert-evaluator**: Evaluation service
   - Runs with `[evaluation,cli]` extras
   - Evaluates traces every hour
   - Saves results to JSON

3. **cert-reporter**: Compliance report generator
   - Runs with `[cli,compliance]` extras
   - Generates reports daily
   - Saves to dated markdown files

**Usage:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f cert-core
docker-compose exec cert-evaluator cert evaluate /var/log/cert/traces.jsonl
```

**Impact:** Production-ready deployment example

---

### 6. **deployments/README.md** (NEW) ✅
**Created:** Documentation for deployment configurations

**Contents:**
- Status of legacy deployment configs (docker/, kubernetes/, prometheus/, grafana/)
- Instructions to use new root-level Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Quick start guide for v4.0 deployments
- Migration notes for users of legacy configs
- Future plans for K8s/Helm/cloud platform support

**Impact:** Clear guidance on which deployment configs to use
