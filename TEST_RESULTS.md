# CERT Framework Test Results

Test completed: October 16, 2024

## Summary

✅ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKS**
- Python API: WORKING
- LangChain Integration: WORKING (tests pass)
- CLI Tools: PARTIALLY WORKING

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Python Integration ✅ PASS
**Status**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**What Works**:
- ✅ `from cert import compare` - imports successfully
- ✅ Basic comparison with confidence scores
- ✅ Threshold adjustment (0.0 - 1.0)
- ✅ Semantic equivalence detection
- ✅ Contradiction detection
- ✅ Error handling (ValueError for empty strings)
- ✅ ComparisonResult object with matched/confidence

**Test File**: `test_python_e2e.py`

**Safe to claim**: "Python integration with semantic comparison API"

### 2. LangChain Integration ✅ PASS
**Status**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**What Works**:
- ✅ `cert.wrap(chain)` - wraps LangChain chains
- ✅ `.withConsistency()` - adds consistency checking
- ✅ `.withAccuracy()` - adds accuracy checking
- ✅ ConsistencyError/AccuracyError thrown correctly
- ✅ Test runner integration
- ✅ All 8 unit tests passing

**Test Results**:
```
✓ src/wrapper.test.ts (8 tests) 2ms
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  8 passed (8)
```

**Safe to claim**: "LangChain integration with automatic testing wrappers"

### 3. CLI Tools ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Status**: MIXED - Some commands work, some are placeholders

**What Works**:
- ✅ `cert init` - Creates cert.config.ts successfully
- ✅ `cert --help` - Shows command help
- ⚠️ `cert analyze` - Runs but needs --test-id, requires SQLite
- ⚠️ `cert test` - Shows placeholder message, not fully implemented
- ⚠️ `cert inspect` - Shows placeholder, points to @cert/inspector

**Test Results**:
```bash
# cert init
✓ Created ./cert.config.ts
Next steps:
  1. Edit cert.config.ts to define your tests
  2. Run: cert test
  3. Open inspector: cert inspect

# cert analyze
Failed to create SQLite storage: Error: better-sqlite3 is required
Please specify --test-id <id> to analyze a specific test

# cert test
Test execution will be implemented once config loading is added.
Example test results: [placeholder]

# cert inspect
[Placeholder] Inspector server would start here
```

**Safe to claim**: "CLI tools for project initialization (cert init works)"
**NOT safe to claim**: "Complete CLI testing workflow"

### 4. Inspector UI ❌ PLACEHOLDER
**Status**: EXISTS BUT NOT FUNCTIONAL

**What Exists**:
- packages/inspector/ directory with Next.js app
- CLI command that references it
- Placeholder implementation

**What Doesn't Work**:
- Inspector doesn't actually start
- No integration with test results
- Separate demo, not connected to framework

**Do NOT claim**: "Inspector UI" as a working feature

## Recommendations

### Ship Today (What Actually Works)
1. **Python API** - `from cert import compare`
   - Works perfectly
   - 5 production examples
   - Documentation complete

2. **LangChain Integration** - `cert.wrap(chain)`
   - Tests passing
   - API stable
   - Ready for use

3. **CLI Init** - `cert init`
   - Works reliably
   - Creates config file
   - Good developer experience

### Roadmap (Not Ready)
1. **CLI Test Command** - Placeholder only
2. **CLI Analyze Command** - Needs work, SQLite dependency
3. **Inspector UI** - Exists as separate demo, not integrated

### Marketing Language

**✅ USE THIS**:
- "Python semantic comparison API"
- "LangChain testing integration"
- "CLI project initialization (cert init)"
- "5 production-ready examples"

**❌ DON'T USE THIS**:
- "Complete CLI testing workflow"
- "Inspector UI" (unless you say "preview" or "coming soon")
- "Full test automation" (test command doesn't work yet)

## Files Created

1. `test_python_e2e.py` - Python integration test (6 tests)
2. This summary document

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update README to reflect what actually works
2. ✅ Move incomplete features to "Roadmap" section
3. ✅ Create one complete, working example
4. Ship what works, iterate on the rest

## Bottom Line

**The core value proposition works**: Python developers can use `compare()` to test LLM outputs for semantic equivalence. LangChain users can wrap chains with `cert.wrap()`. Everything else is either roadmap or needs refinement.

This is enough to generate revenue TODAY with honest marketing.
