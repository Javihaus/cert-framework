# Temperature Configuration Changes - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all changes made to improve temperature configuration in the CERT framework, addressing the need for fair, reproducible model comparisons.

## Problem Statement

**Original Issue:** The framework used `temperature=0.7` by default, which:
- Introduced unnecessary randomness in benchmarking
- Made model comparisons less fair and reproducible
- Deviated from industry standards (OpenAI Evals, HuggingFace benchmarks use temp=0)
- Conflated model-inherent consistency with sampling randomness

**Solution:** Changed default to `temperature=0.0` (deterministic) and added comprehensive configuration options with clear guidance.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Configuration (cert/agents/config.py)

#### Added TemperatureMode Enum
```python
class TemperatureMode(Enum):
    """Temperature presets for different testing scenarios."""
    DETERMINISTIC = 0.0  # For reproducible benchmarking (RECOMMENDED)
    FACTUAL = 0.3        # For factual/deterministic tasks
    BALANCED = 0.7       # For general-purpose testing
    CREATIVE = 1.0       # For creative/generative scenarios
```

#### Changed Default Temperature
```python
# OLD: temperature: float = 0.7
# NEW: temperature: float = 0.0  # Deterministic for reproducible benchmarking
```

#### Added Helper Method
```python
@classmethod
def from_temperature_mode(cls, mode: TemperatureMode, **kwargs):
    """Create config with temperature set from a TemperatureMode preset."""
    kwargs['temperature'] = mode.value
    return cls(**kwargs)
```

#### Enhanced Documentation
- Added detailed docstring explaining temperature parameter
- Included guidance on when to use different temperature values
- Referenced TemperatureMode enum in docs

### 2. Module Exports (cert/agents/__init__.py)

Added `TemperatureMode` to exports:
```python
from .config import AssessmentConfig, MetricConfig, TemperatureMode

__all__ = [
    ...
    "TemperatureMode",
    ...
]
```

### 3. Examples Updated (examples/agents/assess_llm_providers.py)

Changed from:
```python
temperature=0.7,
```

To:
```python
temperature=0.0,  # Deterministic for reproducible, fair model comparison
```

### 4. Tests Enhanced (tests/test_basic_functionality.py)

Added comprehensive test coverage:

1. **test_create_default_config**: Updated to verify default=0.0
2. **test_temperature_mode_enum**: Verifies all enum values
3. **test_config_from_temperature_mode**: Tests factory method
4. **test_temperature_validation**: Tests boundary validation

### 5. Documentation Created (docs/TEMPERATURE_GUIDE.md)

Created comprehensive 400+ line guide covering:
- Why temperature matters for testing
- Impact on consistency, reproducibility, model comparison
- Detailed explanation of each TemperatureMode
- Recommendations by use case (benchmarking, compliance, production simulation, etc.)
- Trial count guidelines for different temperatures
- Common pitfalls and best practices
- FAQ section
- Code examples for each scenario

### 6. README Updated (README.md)

Enhanced AssessmentConfig section with:
- Three configuration options (default, preset modes, custom)
- Quick temperature guidance table
- Link to comprehensive TEMPERATURE_GUIDE.md

## Usage Examples

### For Model Benchmarking (Recommended)
```python
from cert.agents import AssessmentConfig

config = AssessmentConfig(
    consistency_trials=20,
    temperature=0.0,  # Default - deterministic, fair comparison
)
```

### Using Temperature Presets
```python
from cert.agents import AssessmentConfig, TemperatureMode

config = AssessmentConfig.from_temperature_mode(
    TemperatureMode.DETERMINISTIC,
    consistency_trials=20
)
```

### For Production Simulation
```python
config = AssessmentConfig.from_temperature_mode(
    TemperatureMode.BALANCED,  # temperature=0.7
    consistency_trials=30  # More trials needed for higher temp
)
```

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

**If you were using default configuration:**
```python
# OLD behavior (implicit temperature=0.7)
config = AssessmentConfig()

# NEW behavior (temperature=0.0)
config = AssessmentConfig()  # Now deterministic!

# To restore old behavior:
config = AssessmentConfig(temperature=0.7)
# OR
config = AssessmentConfig.from_temperature_mode(TemperatureMode.BALANCED)
```

**If you were explicitly setting temperature=0.7:**
```python
# You can continue using explicit temperature
config = AssessmentConfig(temperature=0.7)

# Or use the new preset
config = AssessmentConfig.from_temperature_mode(TemperatureMode.BALANCED)
```

**No breaking changes:** Existing code with explicit `temperature` parameter continues to work.

## Rationale

### Why temperature=0.0 as default?

1. **Industry Standard Alignment**
   - OpenAI Evals: temperature=0
   - HuggingFace Leaderboards: temperature=0
   - Academic benchmarking: greedy decoding
   - HELM, BigBench, etc.: deterministic sampling

2. **Reproducibility**
   - Critical for compliance/audit documentation
   - Essential for regression testing
   - Enables fair A/B testing between model versions

3. **Fair Model Comparison**
   - Isolates model capabilities from sampling effects
   - Different models respond differently to temperature
   - Level playing field for evaluation

4. **Statistical Efficiency**
   - Lower variance = fewer trials needed
   - temperature=0.0: 10-20 trials sufficient
   - temperature=0.7: 25-35 trials recommended
   - Cost and time savings

5. **Framework Purpose**
   - CERT is for "systematic assessment" and "data-driven decisions"
   - Deterministic testing aligns with these goals
   - Production simulation can use higher temperature when needed

### Why keep temperature configurable?

1. **Production Simulation**: Some users need to test at production temperature
2. **Creative Testing**: Some use cases require diversity testing
3. **Flexibility**: Different scenarios have different needs
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work

## Conclusion

These changes improve CERT's position as a professional, standards-aligned AI system testing framework while maintaining full backward compatibility and adding powerful new configuration options.

The default of `temperature=0.0` aligns with industry best practices and the framework's core mission of providing "statistical rigor" and "data-driven decisions" for model assessment.
